Goal: Ge' that mf to read properly.

TODO

+ Read file
    + Line by line, baby

* Organise Content
    * Make struct Person that includes name & array of friends
	* Friend includes name and weight.
    + Make array that holds all Person(s)
	* This may need to be dynamic
	+ (No it doesn't)
    + Input line: first two strings before comma are names, the last is their shared weight.
    * Check if names already exist, make a new Person if they don't, and input data.
    * If Person exists, then update friend-list with the other Name(+ weight).

+ Organise content, but better
    + One struct contains everything of value on a line, sorted
	+ See "Input line" above
	+ Struct contains Source, Target, and their shared weight

- While(true) loop for inputs
    - run the correct action with given input
	- If they input L, Give them list of Person names
	    - Make a second array when called that contains all UNIQUE names in the first array
	    - Run the second array to list everyone 
	- If they input R & a Person Name, list all their friends, and their weights
	    - for_loop to find them, and then print all other related in struct + weight 
	- If they input Q, return 0
    - refuse any improper input (both key and name)

- Profit(?)

Made a plan, hope it works.
I'll update the "-" on the TODO with a + as they are completed
(* means abandoned)

The file reading works, the data is in the stack stack. 
Inputing data to the structs was a pain to get working, but it's done.
We were given 2 weeks to do this, but it's only the second day and I'm almost done... 
...Is the .json interpreter that much harder?

EoD update, the thrones[kings] never updates position in the array, something fucked up.

    [[30/8]]
After spending most of last night trying to find where kings wasn't working, 
I gave up, and started anew.

After helping Julius, I found that there was an even more convenient way to 
organise all my information, and so abandoned all my previous work to adopt it.

A small error in the order of two operations led me to almost restart the project. Again.
Thank god I spotted it.
Fyi: if you're gonna read from an array, make sure you're reading the
right position, and not the next one over.
Also, if you want to copy a char[] to another, 
make sure you're copying the content, and not the pointers.
I've only got the relations input left to do. Everything else works as it should.

The Rest of the program already worked, so I finished by making the "list friends" thing in about
10min. I had a bit of extra time, so I decided to use strcmp() to bubble sort the array I use in
"list people", finishing all the requirements for the assignment.
I finished up the last bits with a surprising lack or errors. I was expecting one last "fuck you",
but it never arrived.
